# EB: Troll


**Supports the ESX framework**

A fun little script I made because I was bored...

**Installation**

Start the script and you're good to go. (Make sure to install all requirements)

**Key Features**

* Crash: Crash a player with /crashplayer [ID]
* Launch: Launch a player into the air with /launchplayer [ID]
* Explode: Explode a player with /explodeplayer [ID]
* Optimized: 0.00ms idle and when used
* Secure: Uses lib callbacks instead of server events (protected from modders)
* Logs: All actions are logged to a Discord webhook (if enabled)

**Requirements**

* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/)

**Note:** If you find any errors or have ideas for the script, please let me know.
